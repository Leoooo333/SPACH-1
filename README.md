# Usage

## NPU
NPU means neural-network processing units. 

To enable NPU, use parser argument
>**--npu**

## Install
First, clone the repo and install requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Spach
```

+ install requirement
```
pip3 install torchvision==0.6.0
pip3 install einops==0.4.1
pip3 install --no-deps timm==0.4.5

# other recommended requirements
apex==0.1+ascend.20220315
torch==1.5.0+ascend.post5.20220315
```
- source env and buildï¼š

```
source ./test/env_npu.sh
```

## Data preparation

Download and extract ImageNet train and val images from http://image-net.org/. 
The directory structure is the standard layout for the torchvision [`datasets.ImageFolder`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder), 
and the training and validation data is expected to be in the `train/` folder and `val/` folder respectively:

```
/path/to/imagenet/
  train/
    class1/
      img1.jpeg
    class2/
      img2.jpeg
  val/
    class1/
      img3.jpeg
    class/2
      img4.jpeg
```

## Training & Evaluation

One can simply call the following script to run training process. Distributed training is recommended even on single GPU node. 

To train a model on NPU, run `main.py` with the desired model architecture and the path to the ImageNet dataset:


```bash
# training 1p accuracy
bash ./test/train_full_1p.sh --model=model_name \
--data_path=real_data_path

# training 1p performance
bash ./test/train_performance_1p.sh --model=model_name \
--data_path=real_data_path

# training 8p accuracy
bash ./test/train_full_8p.sh --model=model_name \
--data_path=real_data_path

# training 8p performance
bash ./test/train_performance_8p.sh --model=model_name \
--data_path=real_data_path

#evaluate 8p accuracy
bash ./test/train_eval_8p.sh --model=model_name \
--data_path=real_data_path \
--resume=checkpoint_path
```
